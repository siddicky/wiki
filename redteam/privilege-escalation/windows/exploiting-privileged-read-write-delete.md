Another technique found by sailay1996 is to place a DLL as `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\tzres.dll` and then run `systeminfo` . This will give a shell as NetworkService which can be turned into a SYSTEM shell with [NetworkServiceExploit ](https://github.com/decoder-it/NetworkServiceExploit). Additional techniques can be found [here ](https://github.com/sailay1996/awesome_windows_logical_bugs/blob/master/FileWrite2system.txt).
