#### DeepLog

View log entries as elements of a sequence that follow certain patterns and grammar rules. A system log is produced by a program that follows a rigorous set of logic and control flows, and is very much like a natural language. DeepLog is a deep neural network that models this sequence of log entries using a Long Short-Term Memory \(LSTM\). 

#### Ensemble-Based Online Machine Learning Algorithms for Network Intrusion Detection Systems Using Streaming Data

Operates on streams of data, trained online or “live” on only a small amount of data kept in memory at a time, as opposed to the more classical approaches that are trained solely offline on all of the data at once.  Each ensemble or stand-alone algorithm runs through a form of online supervised learning where each sample is tested and then trained on in sequence. Compares KNN/SVM/Hoeffding Adapative Trees/Adaptive Random Forests.

#### A Survey of Network-based Intrusion Detection Data Sets

The paper identifies 15 different properties to assess the suitability of individual data sets for specific evaluation scenarios.
